#+TITLE: Manage and upgrade Borg drones

Borg Updater is an extension for [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]], providing a visual interface to
manage and upgrade your drones, along with a few utility functions

* Features

 - **Manually managed upgrades*.  Borg Updater leaves you in full
   control of what, when and how you upgrade.  You may pull everything
   to the more recent commit, or just pull two new commits for a
   specific drone, or maybe pull a drone to the latest commit while
   downgrading another to an older tag.

 - *Stable or unstable mode*.  Borg Updater allows to upgrade only to
   new tags or to each new commit.

 - *PGP signatures*.  Borg Updater allows to define (globally or for
   each drone) a set of valid PGP keys and verify signatures *before*
   building an updated drone.  It has an extra paranoia mode where it
   won't upgrade a drone unless it has a list of valid keys for it,
   and of course the signature can be verified.
