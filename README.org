#+TITLE: Manage and upgrade Borg drones

Borg Queen is a package management frontend for [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]], providing a
visual interface to manage and upgrade your drones, along with a few
utility functions.

It features:

 - A unified package management interface for Borg clones and drones.

 - *Manually managed upgrades*.  Borg Queen leaves you in full
   control of what, when and how you upgrade.  You may pull everything
   to the more recent commit, or just pull two new commits for a
   specific drone, or maybe pull a drone to the latest commit while
   downgrading another to an older tag.

 - *Stable or unstable mode*.  Borg Queen allows to upgrade only to
   new tags or to each new commit.

 - *PGP signatures*.  Borg Queen allows to define (globally or for
   each drone) a set of valid PGP keys and verify signatures *before*
   building an updated drone.  It has an extra paranoia mode where it
   won't upgrade a drone unless it has a list of valid keys for it,
   and of course the signature can be verified.

* Standard bindings

These bindings are active in the Borg Queen interface, which is invoked with =M-x borg-queen RET=.

| Binding | Action                                              |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =u=       | Mark for upgrade                                    |
| =U=       | Mark for auto upgrade or downgrade (see note below) |
| =c=       | Mark for upgrade to most recent commit              |
| =C=       | Prompt for commit, then mark for upgrade            |
| =t=       | Mark for upgrade to latest tag                      |
| =T=       | Prompt for  tag, then mark for upgrade              |
| =A=       | Mark clone for assimilation                         |
| =R=       | Mark for removal                                    |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =x=       | Execute marks                                       |
| =a=       | Assimilate new package as a submodule               |
| =b=       | Clone new package                                   |
| =!=       | Commit changes                                      |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =g=       | Refresh view                                        |

=U= (mark for upgrade or downgrade) will mark for /downgrade/ iff the package is configured to be updated to tags only, it is not currently on a tag, and there are no tags after the current commit.  In this case, it will mark the package for downgrade to the most recent tag.
